# DSA-Journey-Leetcode

Welcome to my LeetCode solution repository! ðŸŽ‰

I am starting this repository from January 2025 to track my daily progress and mastery of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). <br>
This repo will contain my solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by topics and difficulty levels.

## Repository Structure

The problems are categorized by topics, and then further sorted by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).


```scss
Arrays/
  â”œâ”€â”€ Easy/
  â”œâ”€â”€ Medium/
  â”œâ”€â”€ Hard/
```

More topics will be added as I progress, and solutions will be categorized accordingly.

### How to Use This Repository

1. **Daily Commit:** Every day, I will push a solution to a LeetCode problem to this repository.
2. **Topic-Wise Organization:** Solutions are organized by topics (arrays, strings, etc.) and then by their difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).
3. **Solution Files:** Each solution will be pushed to the respective folder with the file name indicating the problem name and its difficulty level.

## Goals

- **Master DSA:** This repo will help me stay consistent in solving DSA problems and mastering topics like Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming, etc.
- **Track Progress:** By pushing my daily solutions, I will track my journey from Easy to Hard problems in each topic.
- **Prepare for Interviews:** This collection will also serve as my practice for coding interviews, ensuring I have a solid foundation in DSA.

## Topics Covered

I will be solving LeetCode problems daily and categorizing them by topic and difficulty level. Below is the structure:

Total Count: [count] <br>

1. **Arrays**
   - Easy: [count]
   - Medium: [count]
   - Hard: [count]

Each topic will have problems categorized into Easy, Medium, and Hard levels to track my progress effectively.

## Track My Progress

- This repository is designed to maintain a daily streak of daily problem-solving.
- I will push solutions every day starting from January 2025.

## Disclaimer
- All solutions are my personal work, and the goal is to improve my DSA skills.
- Problems are solved in Java.
